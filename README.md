[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Click%20Here-brightgreen)](https://github.com/aldi12xz/ComfyUi-TextEncodeQwenImageEditAdvanced/releases)

## 📖 Intro
Qwen Image Edit uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to analyze your images and enhance your prompts with more detailed descriptions. This application helps you adjust your images effectively.

By default, the TextEncodeQwenImageEdit node downscales your images to 0.15 megapixels before sending them to the VLM. This custom node allows you to manage that threshold (vl_megapixels). You can find the right settings for your needs.

Making adjustments can lead to:

- Improved style preservation for your images
- A reduced zoom effect: Help Qwen Image Edit avoid zooming in too much on images
